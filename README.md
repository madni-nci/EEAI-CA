## Introduction

This project is designed to [provide a brief description of the project's purpose and functionality]. The project consists of various scripts for preprocessing data, generating embeddings, and the main execution.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the settings**: Update the `Config.py` file with the necessary parameters.
2. **Preprocess the data**: Run the `preprocess.py` script.
3. **Generate embeddings**: Use the `embeddings.py` script.
4. **Execute the main script**: Run the `main.py` script to process the data and generate results.

## Files

### Config.py

This file contains configuration settings for the project. Update the parameters as needed.

### preprocess.py

This script handles the preprocessing of data. It reads raw data, cleans it, and prepares it for further processing.

### embeddings.py

This script generates embeddings from the preprocessed data. It uses the specified model and techniques to convert data into a suitable format for analysis.

### main.py

The main script of the project. It integrates the preprocessed data and embeddings to perform the primary tasks of the project.

### out.csv

This file contains the output results generated by the `main.py` script.

## Configuration

The `Config.py` file should be updated with the appropriate settings before running the scripts. This includes paths to data files, model parameters, and any other necessary configuration.
